Calling os.Exit in a function assigned to flag.Usage

The `flag` package has the notion of a `Usage` function, assigned to
`flag.Usage` or `flag.FlagSet.Usage`. The job of this function is to
print usage instructions for the program and it is called when invalid
flags were provided.

This function should not, however, terminate the program by calling
`os.Exit`. The `flag` package already has a mechanism for exiting on
incorrect flags, the `errorHandling` argument of `flag.NewFlagSet`.
Setting it to `flag.ExitOnError` instructs it to call `os.Exit(2)`.
There exist other values to react differently, which is why `Usage`
shouldn't call `os.Exit` on its own.
